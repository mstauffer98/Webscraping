This project was designed to practice and play around with web-scraping techniques.
I have been using the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List as a demonstration. FBI.gov
has specifically allocated permission to (at least American) users, as described in
their robots.txt file. The "FBIMostWantedWebScraper.py" file currently reads out the
top ten most wanted criminals by the FBI. I look to expand this file or apply the
technique to other websites to create an even more interesting project.

This project is yet to be completed.
